# **App Name**: Mine Assistant

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Code Generation tool: Provide fully working, clean, production-ready code with proper comments, based on the user's prompt and related technologies; incorporate code and practices to use the latest libraries and follow best practices in programming, unless otherwise directed.
- Fact Verification tool: Answer accurately, and act as a tool to verify information before answering user queries.
- Markdown Code Formatting: Use Markdown formatting and proper syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Default Language: Suggest the use of Python 3.11+ as the default programming language unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Library Check tool: Whenever offering suggestions related to coding and software implementation, always check that no deprecated or obsolete libraries are suggested, by referring to external data as needed. Act as a tool, only using suggestions that represent currently best practices.
- Project Delivery: Remind the user of your ability to deliver multi-part projects by delivering complete file contents one-by-one, and explain folder structure if requested.
- Honest Error Handling: If unsure about any information, communicate that honestly. Say 'I don't know' instead of guessing. If no information exists for a topic, notify the user, rather than presenting falsified information. Act as a responsible, reliable assistant.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust, intelligence, and a tech-forward approach. It is dark enough to be readable as text on a light background, but also bright enough to suggest optimism.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4FF), creating a clean and professional look without being too stark.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter, but still analogous blue (#42A5F5) to provide contrast on interactive elements like buttons or links.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter text snippets to give a computerized, techy feel; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer sections of text because of its neutral, modern and machined look. This is a classic pairing of Space Grotesk with Inter.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets, ensuring readability and differentiation from regular text.
- Use minimalist, clear icons representing various functions and categories (e.g., coding, data science, blockchain) for easy navigation and quick understanding.
- Clean, organized layout with a focus on readability and ease of use. Use of white space to avoid clutter and guide the user through the information.
